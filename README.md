#goof - share files through HTTP protocol

goof (Go Offer One File) is a very simple tool to send and receive files on your
local LAN. 

Features include:

 * Serve files just for a given number of times and then exit.
 * Share a directory and it's sub directories over HTTP.
 * Serve only one specified file.
 * Receive files via a simple html form to upload files via /upload/
 * Disable upload functionality
 * More to come..


Note 1: You need the [go][] runtime, <http://golang.org/>

Note 2: this is just a toy project in my adventures in the go language, it probably works
but not the cleanest code around ;)
